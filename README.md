Let's Blogging...  (ง •̀_•́)ง  

Introduction
-
Oooops. First introduce my blog -> <a href="https://www.opbear.com">www.opbear.com</a>  
Idea from my friend @Jackeriss -> <a href="https://github.com/Jackeriss/Typora-Blog">Typora-Blog</a>

Using Bear write blogs and export as .html file -> <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com">Bearwriter</a>  
And you have to pay for Bear Pro for using this advanced feature.

Feature
-
1. Simple and light. No more than blogging and display, include about me page.
2. Using memory to cache data when initializing. No db required.
3. Do what you want with it. Inspire your imagination - 人有多大胆 地有多大产.

Usage
-
#### Deploy
Copy your new blogs into templates/articles and restart.

#### Customize
Yes it's not for totaly freshman. Cause you have to modify template file(.html) yourself of your own device.
Program accept one argument with enviroment. `--help` for details.

#### Convention over configuration
1. Write with Bear note.
2. Wrap the abstract using <div class="description"></div>.
3. Export with .html suffix and put into templates/articles.
4. Restart program. (For me I just restart program on supervisor - highly recommand).
